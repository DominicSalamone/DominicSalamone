### Hi there 👋

- My name is Dominic Salamone, and I'm currently studying Computer Science at college. I aspire to one day get a carrer as a computer programmer, or a game designer.
- I have a burning passion towards video games and learning how they are made.
- :feelsgood: I am a big fan of the doom games.
